Figure 6 | Direct phosphorylation of recombinant SNAP-23 (rSNAP-23) at Ser95 by recombinant PKM2 (rPKM2). (a) Direct phosphorylation of rSNAP-23 by rPKM2. The rSNAP-23 was incubated with or without PEP, rPKM2 or PEP plus rPKM2 at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to SDS-PAGE or Phos-tag SDS-PAGE analysis. SNAP-23 was detected by anti-SNAP-23 antibody in WB analysis. (b) Phosphorylated SNAP-23 by rPKM2 analysed by mass spectrometry (MS). Note that MS analysis of tryptic fragment of rSNAP-23 treated with PEP/rPKM2 matches to the peptide 92NFESGK97 of SNAP-23, suggesting that SNAP-23 Ser95 was phosphorylated. 
rSNAP-23 was phosphorylated by the rPKM2 in the presence of PEP, confirming that PKM2 acts as a protein kinase to remove the phosphate group from PEP and puts the phosphate on SNAP-23. To identify the phosphorylation site on SNAP-23 used by PKM2, we further performed mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of purified recombinant SNAP-23 after phosphorylation assay (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org, accession code: PXD005204). After fragmentation using trypsin, MS analysis identified a phosphorylated fragment matched to the peptide 92NFESGK97, suggesting that Ser95 was phosphorylated (Fig. 6b). The theoretical mass-to-charge ratio of ions with Ser95 phosphorylation (Y + ions) and Ser95 dephosphorylation (Y -P ions) are listed in Fig. 6b. There were five ions detected and marked in red. To further examine the role of phosphorylation of SNAP-23 by PKM2 in mediating tumour cell exosome release, we constructed three plasmids expressing SNAP-23 mutants. The Ser95 of wild-type (WT) SNAP-23 was replaced with Glu95 (SNAP-23 (Ser95 —+ Glu95)), whose carbolyic acid side chain will mimic the effect of phosphorylation. In contrast, to render a constitutively dephosphorylated state, we replaced Ser95 of WT SNAP-23 with Ala95 (SNAP-23 (Ser95 —o Ala95)). To ensure that serine phosphorylation by PKM2 is the critical factor (as opposed to phosphorylation of some other residue) enabling the role of SNAP-23 in exosome exocytosis, we also mutated Ser20 of SNAP-23 to Glu20 (SNAP-23 (Ser20-.Glu20)). In addition to generating three mutated versions of SNAP-23 DNA, we also generated siRNA-resistant constructs for each of our three mutated SNAP-23 plasmids. As shown in Figs 3 and 7a nucleotides within the binding sequence of SNAP-23 siRNA on SNAP-23 transcript were mutated to prevent siRNA binding without changing the amino acid sequence. As these His-tagged SNAP-23-expressing constructs are resistant to the effect of SNAP-23 siRNA, we designed them as R-SNAP-23 and R-SNAP-23 (Ser95-•ua95), respectively WT SNAP-23 and SNAP-23 mutants were then expressed into the A549 cells and the release of exosomes at 24h post-incubation was assayed by NT A. We found that knockdown of cellular SNAP-23 level via SNAP-23 siRNA significantly decreased exosome secretion (Fig. 7b). However, transfecting cells with R-SNAP-23 plasmid completely recovered the exosome secretion level. In contrast, transfecting cells with R-SNAP-23 (Ser95 —o Ala95) plasmid, which express an SNAP-23 protein that cannot be phosphory- lated, failed to recover exosome secretion. Taken together, these results suggest that lack of phosphorylation of Ser95 on SNAP-23 would impair exosome secretion. The role of SNAP-23 Ser95 phosphorylation in promoting tumour cell exosome secretion was confirmed in cells transfected with the His-tagged SNAP-23 (Ser95 —o Glu95) construct that mimics constitutively phosphory- lated SNAP-23 at Ser95. As shown in Fig. 7c, knockdown of cellular PKM2 via PKM2 siRNA markedly decreased exosome secretion. However, the reduction of exosome secretion by PKM2 siRNA was completely recovered by transfecting cells with His-tagged SNAP-23 (Ser95 plasmid, which express an SNAP-23 form that is in constitutively phosphorylated state.
