The levels of phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated SNAP-23 in A549 cells assessed by SDS-PAGE or Phos-tag SDS-PAGE analysis, respectively. (a) A549 cells were treated with EGF or CA, or transfected with PKM2 siRNA or HA-PKM2-expressing plasmid. (b) A549 cells were treated with pTyr, FBP or serine. Data are presented as the mean s.e.m. of three independent experiments. • P •.05. • *Pc: 0.01 as determined by the one-way ANOVA test. 
To confirm the association of PKM2 and SNAP-23 during the exosome release process, we performed the cross- immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment using anti-SNAP-23 and anti-PKM2 antibodies. In this experiment, A549 cell lysate was subjected to pre-clearance with control IgG and then incubated with anti-SNAP-23 or anti-PKM2 antibodies for IP. The immunoprecipitated products were blotted with anti-PKM2 or anti-SNAP-23 antibodies in a cross manner. As shown in Fig. 4c, immunoprecipitating SNAP-23 by anti-SNAP-23 antibody pulled down not only SNAP-23 but also PKM2 (left panel). As a control, neither protein was detected in IgG-immunprecipitated complex. In a similar fashion, immunoprecipitating PKM2 by anti-PKM2 antibody pulled down not only PKM2 but also SNAP-23 (right panel). The double IF and cross-IP results collectively suggest that PKM2 is associated with SNAP-23 during tumour cell exosome release. Phosphorylation of SNAP-23 mediates tumour exocytosis. Recent studies have shown that dimerized phosphorylated-PKM2 possesses low catalytic activity in converting PEP to pyruvate but can serve as a protein kinase in phosphorylating other molecules such as STAT3 (ref. 21), histone H3 (refs 32,34) and MLC2 (ref. 40). Given that SNAP-23 phosphorylation is required for exocytosis and PKM2, particularly phosphorylated PKM2, is associated with SNAP-23 during exosome secretion, we speculated that PKM2 might promote tumour cell exosome secretion through phosphorylating SNAP-23. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the level of phosphorylated SNAP-23 in A549 cells after modulating cellular PKM2 level via EGF or OA treatment (fetal bovine serum (FBS) as control), or transfection with plasmids expressing HA-PKM2 (CTL vector as control) or PKM2 siRNA (ncRNA as control). As shown in Fig. 5a, increase of PKM2 level via direct overexpression of PKM2 or EGF treat- ment significantly elevated the level of phosphorylated SNAP-23. In contrast, decrease of PKM2 level via transfection with PKM2 siRNA or OA treatment reduced the level of SNAP-23 phos- phorylation. Moreover, direct alteration of dimeric or tetrameric formation of PKM2 obtained similar results. As shown in Fig. 5b, when A549 cells were treated with pTyr to increase the level of dimerized PKM2, the level of phosphorylated SNAP-23 was markedly elevated. In contrast, when treating A549 cells with FBP or serine to facilitate PKM2 tetrameric formation, the level of phosphorylated SNAP-23 was strongly reduced. These results indicate that phosphorylated PKM2, that is, dimerized PKM2, is involved in SNAP-23 phosphorylation. We next sought to test whether dimerized PKM2 could directly phosphorylate SNAP-23. An in vitro phosphorylation assay was performed using both the recombinant SNAP-23 (rSNAP-23) and the recombinant PKM2 (rPKM2) purified from nuclear extracts of SW620 cells21. Since PKM2 uses PEP instead of ATP as a phosphate donor to phosphorylate ADP in the glycolysis, we replaced ATP by PEP in the in vitro reaction. After incubation under various conditions at room temperature for I h, the reaction mixtures were then subjected to SDS-PAGE or Phos-tag SDS-PAGE analysis detection of SNAP-23 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 6a, WB analysis demonstrated that the
