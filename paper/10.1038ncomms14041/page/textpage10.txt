analysed per video. The NTA analytical software version 2.3 was used for capturing and analysing the data. Phos-tag SDS-PAGE and western blot. Phos-tag SDS-PAGE was performed with 7.5% polyacrylamine gels containing 50-100 PM Phos-tag acrylamine and 100-200gM MnC12. After electrophoresis, Phos-tag acrylamine gels were washed with transfer buffer (50mM Tris, 384mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, 20% methanol) containing 1 mM EDTA for 10 min with gentle shaking as per the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were transfected to PVDF membranes and probed with antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immuno-detection was carried out with the Millipore Immobilon chemilumines- cent horseradish peroxidase substrate. Normalization was conducted by blotting the same samples with an antibody against actin. All the uncropped data was shown in Supplementary Fig. 9. Cell-based assay for glucose uptake and lactate production. The levels of glucose uptake by tumour or non-tumour cells were measured with a Glucose Uptake Cell-Based Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Ml, USA). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of I x 104 cells per well. After 24h, glucose uptake assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Relative fluorescence units were determined at 485—535 nm using a VARIOSKAN FLASH (Thermo). The levels of lactate production were examined with a Lactate Assay Kit (Biovision, Milpitas, CA, USA). Cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 1 x 106 cells per plate. After incubation for 24 h the culture medium was replaced with FBS-free DMEM. After further 8 h incubation, lactate assays were performed with culture media collected from each sample according to the man- ufacturer's protocol and the optical density was measured at 570 nm using a Multiskan EX (Thermo). Transfection of cells with plasmid and siRNA. We designed three siRNA oligonucleotides for each target and tested the effects of three siRNA oligonu- cleotides on gene silence and exosome secretion prior to experiments. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 8, the siRNA oligonucleotides against one given target showed a similar inhibitory effect and the siRNA oligonucleotides with the best effect of gene silence for each target were selected in our experiments. The siRNA sequences are as follows: siPKM1, 5'-GCGUGGAGGCUUCUUAUAA-3'; siPKM2, 5'-CCA UAAUCGUCCUC ACCAA-3', siSNAP-23, 5'-CCAACAGAGAUCGUAUUGA-3'. Cells were seeded in six-well plates or 10-mm dishes, and they were transfected the following day using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; 11668) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells and exosomes were harvested 24 h after transfection for the following assays. was then re-suspended in 100mM DTI' and incubated for 30 min at 56 oc for reduction, followed by treatment of 200 mM IAA for 20 min in the dark for alkylation. The sample was washed with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 100% acetonitrile, and then lyophilized. About 2.5—10 ngpl I Trypsin solution was added into the sample and the sample was incubated for 20 h at 37 oc The remained gel pieces were sonicated for 15 min in extraction buffer and then merged with digested solution. The resulted peptide solution was lyophilized again, re-suspended in 0.1% formic acid and filtered. The peptide solution was auto- sampled onto the reverse phase trap column (75 um ID x 2 cm, 5 gm C18), then was flushed onto the Thermo scientific EASY column (75 gm ID x 100 mm, 5 gm C18) for separation at a flow rate of 250 nl min-I. The column temperature was maintained at 200 oc and interfaced with the mass spectrometer. Mobile phases A and B were 0.1 % formic acid and 0.1% formic acid in 88% acetonitrile, respectively. The total gradient was set as follows: from 0 to 50 min, 4% B increase to 50%; from 50 to 54 min, the column was washed with 50% B to 100% B; then the 100% B was maintained for another 6 min. A Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San lose, CA, USA) was used for MS analysis. The instrument was operated at positive ion mode: MSI spectral were collected at a resolution of 70,000, with an automated gain control (AGC) target of 3,000,000, and a max injection time of 50ms. The m/z range for MSI full scan is 300—1 ,800. Precursors were filtered by quadrupole using isolation window of 2 Th. 10 MS2 spectra were collected after each MSI scan at a resolution of 17,500, with AGC target of 1,000,000, and a max injection time of 100 ms. Precursors were fragmented by at a normalized collision energy of 27%. In vitro protein kinase assay. The kinase reactions were performed as described previously49. In brief, bacterially purified recombinant PKM2 (200 ng) was incubated with SNAP-23 (100 ng) in kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCI, 50 mM MgC12, I mM Na3V04, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM PEP and 0.05 mM FBP) in 25 PI at 25 oc for I h. The reactions were terminated by adding sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading buffer and heating to 100 The reaction mixtures were then subjected to phos-tag SDS-PAGE analyses. Statistical analysis. The GraphPad Prism 5 and SigmaPlot 11.0 packages were used. Data are presented as the means standard error of the mean (s.e.m.). Technical as well as biological triplicates of each experiment were performed. Comparison between two groups was performed by Student's t-test. Multiple- group comparisons were determined using one-way ANOVA. A P—value €0.05 was considered statistically significant. Pearson correlation coefficient (r value) was calculated assuming linear relationship between variables. 
Immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to identify the subcellular localization of PKM2 and SNAP-23 in A549 cells. Cells were cultured on four-well chamber slides. At the time of harvest, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.01 % Triton X- 100 for 10 min and subsequently probed with antibodies against PKM2 and SNAP-23 followed by incubation with fluorescent-tagged secondary antibodies (488 and 594 nm). All samples were treated with DAPI dye for nuclear staining (358 nm). For confocal microscopy, the Nikon C2 Plus confocal microscope was used. Co-IP. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20mM Tris-HCI, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2mM EDTA, 0.5mM DTr, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF and 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail from Sigma, pH 7.4) for 30 min on ice. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (16,000g) for 10 min at 4 oc and then immunoprecipi- tated individually with anti-SNAP-23 antibody, anti-PKM2 antibody or normal lgG followed by protein G-Agarose beads. After the elution, the proteins were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer for WB assays. Chemical crosslinking reaction. Cells were dissociated by Trypsin-EDTA solu- tion, centrifuged at 1000 r.p.m. for 5 min and then washed by PBS and centrifuged as described above. The precipitation was re-suspended with 100 PBS gently and the concentration of total protein was determined by BCA assays. The suspension of cells was diluted to 2 mg ml — I with PBS, and a final volume of 500 PI was needed for the following chemical crosslinking assays. For crosslinking reaction with EDC/sulfo-NHS, 10 gl of a freshly prepared aqueous crosslinker solution was added into 500 gl cell suspension, with final concentrations of EDC and sulfo-NHS of 10 and 5 mM, respectively. The reaction mixtures were gently incubated at room temperature, and the reactions were quenched by the addition of 10 PI aqueous dithiothreitol (Drr), the final concentration of DTI* was 20 mM. Finally, cells were centrifuged at 3000g and 4 oc for the following WB assays. Mass spectrometry analysis. The protein sample was loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE. Upon accomplishment by electrophoresis, the entire gel was fixed and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for I h. Then the gel was detained in 30% acetonitrile/100 mM ammonium bicarbonate until the background was clean. Then the supernatant was removed, and the gel particles were freeze-dried.
