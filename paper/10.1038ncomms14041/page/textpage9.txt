down PKM2 in A549 cells, we failed to find significant alteration in the levels of Rab27a, Rab27b and nSMase2 (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting that PKM2's enhancement of exosome secretion in tumour cells is not mediated through changes in the expression of Rab27a, Rab27b and nSMase2. Our results identify the mechanism through which PKM2 enhances the release of exosomes: PKM2 phosphorylates SNAP-23 at Ser95 enabling the formation of the SNAP complex required for the docking and fusion between endosome-containing MVEs and plasma membranes. PKM2 is best known for catalysing the last step in the process of glycolysis, the transfer of a phosphate group from PEP to ADP yielding the products of pyruvate and ATP. PKM2 exhibits a high level of catalysis for this reaction when protein is in a tetrameric state but not in a dimeric state. PKM2 is particularly likely to form a dimer when tyrosine 105 (Y 105) is phosphorylated34 In its dimeric state, Yang et al.32 found that PKM2 phosphorylates nuclear histone H3 to promote gene transcription. Additional functions of PKM2 have also been recognized. PKM2 was found to activate transcription of MEK5 by phosphorylating STAT 3 at Y 105 (ref. 18) and to regulate cytokinesis of tumour cells via phosphorylating MLC2 (ref. 33). A previous study also showed that IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation requires PKM2, 35 although mechanism remains unclear As catalysis of the last step of glycolysis generally occurs in the cytoplasm, PKM2 particularly PKM2 in its tetrameric form mainly locates in the cytoplasm. In order to phosphorylate various transcription factors, phosphorylated/dimerized PKM2 is required to be relocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In the present study, we suggest that dimerized/phosphorylated PKM2 can also re-locate at the vesicular structures close to the cell plasma membranes where it associates with the component of SNARE complex. Following exosome release from the plasma membrane, PKM2 is found in the secreted exosome fraction. Interestingly, location of PKM2 in secreted exosomes was also detected by Buschow et al.32 in B cells. Given that PKM2 and SNAP-23 are widely expressed in various cell types, the PKM2-SNAP-23 signal pathway may play a critical role in promoting exocytosis in other cell types as well. Our data as well as the data of others offer clues as to the specific environments in the plasma membranes at which SNARE complexes are likely to form. In our study, we found that PKM2 and SNAP-23 co-localize at certain punctate structures close to or on the cell surface (Fig. 4b, arrows). These punctates might be lipid rafts or secretory vesicles very close to lipid rafts on the 20 plasma membrane. Previous study by Suzuki and Verma suggest that SNAP-23 is highly enriched in the lipid raft fraction during stimulated degranulation, and the localization of SNAP-23 in lipid rafts facilitates the phosphorylation of SNAP-23 at Ser95 and Seri20 by IKK 2, leading to SNARE complex formation and degranulation of mast cells. As we did not observe the phosphorylation of SNAP-23 at Ser 120 by PKM2 in the direct phosphorylation assay, the phosphorylation site of SNAP-23 by PKM2 may be not identical for a putative IKK consensus sequences for phosphorylation. Collectively, these studies suggest that PKM2 particularly phosphorylated/dimerized PKM2 can phosphorylate SNAP-23, a key component of exocytosis machinery, to promote tumour cell exosome secretion. In summary, the findings presented here demonstrate a role for PKM2 in the release of exosomes from tumour cells. PKM2 phosphorylates a component of the SNARE complex, SNAP-23 at Ser95. This event is critical to the exocytosis of exosomes. Moreover, the release of exosomes from the tumour cell is highly correlated with the tumour cell's metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis, a metabolic switch in which the perturbation of function of PKM2 is implicated.

Exosomes were collected from equivalent amounts of culture medium, conditioned by equivalent amounts of cells. When reaching 80% of confluency, the cell layers were rinsed with DMEM and refreshed with DMEM containing 2% exosome-depleted FBS. Both sequential centrifugation and exosome isolation kit methods were used to isolate exosome and for further analysis. For sequential centrifugation method, the medium was harvested 24h after cell culture or transfection and exosomes were isolated from the media by three sequential centrifugation steps at 4 oc: 15min at 500g to remove cells; 30 min at 10,000g to remove cell debris; and ultracentrifugation at 110,000g for 70 min (Beckman Ti70) to pellet exosomes. The pellet was re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 110,000g for 70 min to remove soluble serum and secreted proteins. For isolation kit method, the medium was harvested 24 h after cell culture or transfection and then centrifuged at 2,000g for 30 min to remove cells and debris. Supernatant containing the cell-free culture media was transferred to a new tube and added 0.5 volumes of the Total Exosome Isolation reagent (Invitrogen; 4478359). The culture media/reagent mixture was mixed well by vortex and the samples were incubated at 4 oc overnight. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 1 h at 4 cc. Exosomes were contained in the pellet at the bottom of the tube and then re-suspended in PBS for various assays. Transmission electron microscopy assay. For the transmission electron micro- scopy assay, the exosome samples were prepared as above described.

Then, the samples were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol concentration eventually reaching 100%. They were infiltrated with Epon resin (Ted Pella) in a solution of Epon: propylene oxide overnight on a rocker at room temperature. The next day they were placed in fresh Epon for several hours and then embedded in Epon overnight at 60 cc Thin sections were cut on a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome, collected on formvar-coated grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a JEOL JEM 1011 transmission electron microscope at 80kV.
