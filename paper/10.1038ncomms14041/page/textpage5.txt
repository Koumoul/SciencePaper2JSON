Figure 4 | Association of PKM2 with SNAP-23 in tumour cell exosomes. (a) WB analysis of isolated exosome fractions from Hela cells and A549 cells for PKMI, PKM2, p-PKM2 and SNAP-23 expression, 50 ug proteins of each sample were loaded. (b) Double staining of A549 cells with anti-PKM2 (green) and anti-SNAP-23 (red) antibodies. Arrows Indicated the small punctate structures where SNAP-23 and PKM2 were co-localized. (c) Cross-IP and cross-blot of PKM2 and SNAP-23 in isolated exosome fraction from A549 cells using anti-SNAP-23 and anti-PKM2 antibodies, respectively. Immunoprecipitation using normal lgG served as controls. 
particularly the cells with high capacity to secrete exosomes, had a significantly higher level of p-SNAP23 compared with myoblast and MEC. Next, we knocked down SNAP-23 in A549 cells and then assessed the release of exosomes. In a separate experiment, A549 cells were also transfected with HA-PKM2-expressing plasmid or co-transfected with HA-PKM2-expressing plasmid plus SNAP-23 siRNA. As shown in Fig. 3, knockdown of SNAP-23 (Fig. 3b) not only significantly blocked the release of exosome in A549 cells but also almost completely abolished the promotion of exosome release by PKM2 overexpression (Fig. 3c). The results suggest that PKM2-promoted exosome release in tumour cells is through SNAP-23-mediated mechanism. Similar results were also observed when exosomes were isolated using sequential centrifugation method35. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5, exosome release from A549 cells and Hela cells was significantly decreased after knocking down PKM2 via PKM2 siRNA (Supplementary Fig. 5a). In contrast, after overexpression of PKM2 via transfection with HA-PKM2- expressing plasmid, exosome secretion from myoblast and MEC was markedly enhanced (Supplementary Fig. 5b). PKM2 is associated with SNAP-23 during exocytosis process. Further analysis of the protein profiling results showed that SNAP-23, VAMP3 and VAMP7, components of SNARE com- plex, as well as the exocytosis-related Rab small GTPases such as RablA and Rab2A, are present in the exosome fraction secreted by SW480, A549, Hela, 293 T and LLC cells (Supplementary Table l). Based on the model of formation of endosomes, exosomes and MVEs36-38 the membranes of these vesicular structures share many protein and lipid components. However, to our surprise, we also found a considerable level of PKM2, but no PKMI, in the exosome fraction. Further analysis of isolated exosomes from tumour or non-tumour cells, we found that phosphorylated PKM2 was also associated with exosomes secreted by tumour cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). Identification of PKM2 in secreted exosomes has been also reported by Buschow et al.39, whose results showed that PKM2 was co-immunoprecipitated with MHC Il molecules in detergent- solubilized exosomes. The exosome protein profiling data support our hypothesis that PKM2 but not PKMI is involved in modulating tumour cell exosome release. We next analysed the expression and localization of PKM2 and SNAP-23 in A549 cells during exosome release using WB and immunofluorescence (IF) staining assays. As shown in Fig. 4a, WB analysis of exosome fraction isolated from culture medium of A549 cells and Hela cells detected SNAP-23 and PKM2, particularly phosphorylated PKM2 (p-PKM2), but not PKMI, confirming the protein profiling data that secreted exosomes contained SANP-23, PKM2 and p-PKM2 but not PKMI. Double IF staining of SNAP-23 and PKM2 in A549 cells further showed a considerable co-localization of SNAP-23 (red) and PKM2 (green) at certain punctate structures close to or on the cell surface (Fig. 4b, arrows), suggesting that SNAP-23 and PKM2 may be associated with each other when secretory granules or exosome- containing multivesicular bodies dock at the cell's plasma membranes.
