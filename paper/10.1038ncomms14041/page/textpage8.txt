Figure 7 | Phosphorylation of SNAP-23 at Ser95 by PKM2 promotes tumour cell exosome release. (a) Constructs of His-tagged RNAi-resistant SNAP-23 (R-SNAP-23) and SNAP-23 (Ser95—• Ala95) (R-SNAP-23 (Ser95 —•Ala95)), in which three nucleotides in siRNA target sequence were mutated without altering amino acid sequence. (b,c) Effect of SNAP-23 phosphorylation at Ser95 on PKM2-mediated release of exosomes from A549 cells. AS49 cells were transfected with PKM2 siRNA and His-tagged plasmids expressing SNAP-23, R-SNAP-23, R-SNAP-23 SNAP-23 (Ser20—yGlu20) or SNAP-23 The cellular protein levels of SNAP-23, PKM2 and His tag and the exosome concentration in cell culture medium were assayed by WB and NTA after 24h culture, respectively. Data are presented as the mean s.e.m. of three independent experiments. *PC-10.05. • *PCZO.OI. • • •ZO.OOI as determined by the one-way ANOVA test. 
To test whether serine phosphorylation other than Ser95 in SNAP-23 also plays a role in enhancing exosome secretion, we assessed the release of exosomes from cells co-transfected with PKM2 siRNA and His-tagged SNAP-23 (Seno Glu20) plasmid, in which Ser20 was mutated to Glu20 to force SNAP-23 in a constitutively phosphorylated form. As shown, SNAP-23 Glu20) did not recover the reduction of exosome secretion observed when PKM2 was knocked down with siRNA, further attesting to the serine phosphorylation at residue Ser95 of SNAP-23 serving as the critical factor in allowing exosome secretion. Discussion It has been well established that tumour cells have elevated rates of glucose uptake and high lactate production in the presence of oxygen, known as aerobic glycolysis (also termed as the Warburg effect) 41. Switch to glycolysis facilitates the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into nucleotides, amino acids and lipids to meet the requirements of rapid proliferation by tumour cells42. High lactate production also remodels the tumour microenvironment by contributing to angiogenesis, acting as a 43-45 cancer cell metabolic fuel and inducing immunosuppression Apart from Warburg effect, an increased secretion of EVs, which can shuttle reciprocal signals and other molecules between transformed and stromal cells, is another phenomenon observed during tumorigenesis6'46'47 However, few studies have explored the link between the enhanced aerobic glycolysis and active exosome secretion in tumour cells. In the present study, we have shown that PKM2 is the key factor modulating both glycolysis and exosome release. PKM2, an enzyme whose expression is upregulated in tumour cells whose metabolic needs are met through glycolysis, promotes the release of exosomes from turnour cells by phosphorylating Ser95 of SNAP-23, a component of the synaptosome/SNARE complex. First, we demonstrated a positive link between the cell's reliance on glycolysis and exocytosis of exosomes. Moreover, when we inhibited glycolysis, then the exosome release was attenuated. Second, we showed, utilizing knockdown or overexpression of PKM2 in a cell, that PKM2 is pivotal for exosome release. Using various molecules to promote dimerization or tetramerization of PKM2, we showed that dimerization is relevant to exosome release from the cell. Third, we showed that PKM2 promotion of exosome release requires the presence of SNAP-23. Finally, we identified Ser95 as the critical residue in SNAP-23 that is phosphorylated by PKM2 in effecting exosome exocytosis. Collectively, these results confirm that PKM2 phosphorylation of SNAP-23 at Ser95 is a key to SNARE complex formation and the secretion of exosomes in tumour cells. The biogenesis and release of exosomes is a multi-step process modulated by various molecules. Previous studies have shown that sphingolipid ceramide, nSMase2 and Rab small GTPases, such as Rab27a and Rab27b, are involved in regulating different steps of the exosome secretion8-10. Interestingly, after knocking
