feature of tumour development27. In tumour cells, PKM2 forms a dimer, which is catalytically inactive for conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate and production of 28,29 Lowering pyruvate formation provides a growth ATP advantage for tumour progression as blocking production of pyruvate helps to channel the glycolytic intermediates to biosynthesis to meet the demands for tumour cell proliferation. Given that PKM2 plays a key role in switching tumour cell metabolic status from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic 30,31 glycolysis and PKM2 level is increased during tumorigenesis we next tested whether tumour cell exosome release is correlated with the PKM2 expression. In agreement with previous reports, tumour cells contained significantly higher PKM2 level than non-turnour cells (Fig. 2a). In line with the correlation between aerobic glycolysis and exocytosis observed in Fig. l, we found that level of PKM2 was positively correlated with the amount of exosome release in turnour cells (Fig. 2b). In a similar manner, tumour cells also showed significantly higher phosphorylated PKM2 (p-PKM2) level than non-tumour cells (Fig. 2c), and the p-PKM2 level was positively correlated with the amount of exosome release in tumour cells (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, treating A549 lung carcinoma cells with OA (Fig. 2e) or EGF (Fig. 20, which enhanced or suppressed tumour cell exosome release, respectively, we found that the level of PKM2 in A549 cells was dose-dependently decreased by OA or increased by EGF. To determine whether PKM2 particularly p-PKM2 plays a role in modulating the release of exosomes from tumour cells, we assessed exosome release after knocking down PKM2 level in A549 and Hela tumour cells via PKM2 siRNA or overexpressing PKM2 in myoblasts and MEC via HA-tagged PKM2-expressing plasmid. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, knockdown or overexpression of cellular PKM2 levels decreased or enhanced
