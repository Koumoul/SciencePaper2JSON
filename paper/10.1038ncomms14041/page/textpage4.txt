p-PKM2 levels. NTA results clearly showed that knockdown of PKM2 in A549 and Hela cells (Fig. 2g) strongly reduced the release of exosomes (Fig. 2h). In contrast, overexpression of HA-tagged PKM2 (HA-PKM2) in non-tumour cells (Fig. 2i) markedly enhanced the release of exosomes (Fig. 2j). Given that apoptotic cells secrete more exosomes than healthy cells and aerobic glycolysis inhibitor or PKM2 knockdown may affect cell apoptosis, we next determined the effects of shikonin and PKM2 knockdown on cell apoptosis using flow cytometry. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, both shikonin treatment and PKM2 knockdown significantly increased early or late apoptosis of A549 cells. Considering that total exosome release from A549 cells is decreased after shikonin treatment or PKM2 knockdown, increase of cell apoptosis by shikonin treatment or PKM2 knockdown further demonstrates that PKM2-mediated aerobic glycolysis promotes tumour cell exosome release. Furthermore, given that switching the behaviour of PKM2 from a tetramer form to a dimer form increases the initial steps of tumour cell 21,32 aerobic glycolysis and promotes tumour progression we treated A549 cells with pTyr, a phosphotyrosine peptide 33 that can promote PKM2 dimeric formation or fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and serine, two molecules that enhance 34 PKM2 tetrameric formation . To assess the dimeric or tetrameric formation of PKM2, chemical crosslinking reaction was carried out to maintain the polymer structure before WB analysis21. Parallel samples without crosslinking treatment were included as loading controls. As expected, pTyr treatment increased the level of PKM2 dimer (116 kDa), while FBP and serine enhanced tetrameric formation (232 kDa) in A549 cells (Fig. 2k). Consistent with the configuration of PKM2 either facilitating or reducing exosome exocytosis, pTyr, induced dimeric PKM2, increased turnour cell exosome exocytosis, while FBP and serine, which induced tertrameric PKM2, significantly decreased tumour cell exosome exocytosis (Fig. 21). In addition, through assaying the level change and the effect on secretion exosomes of PKMI, we found that pyruvate kinase activity of PKM might be not relevant to tumour cell exosome secretion. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, overexpression or knockdown of P KM 1 in Hela and A549 cells displayed no effect on the release of exosomes from tumour cells. Taken together, these results strongly argue that PKM2, particularly phosphory- lated PKM2 which easily dimerizes, plays an essential role in promoting the release of exosomes. PKM2-promoted exosome release is dependent on SNAP-23. As a critical component of general cell exocytosis machinery, SNAP-23 has been widely reported to be involved in controlling cell exocytosis We isolated exosomes released by SW480, A549, Hela, 293 T and LLC cells, and then performed mass spectra analysis and an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) assay for protein expression profiling. As expected, protein profiling analysis showed that SNAP-23 was the only component of SNARE complex detected in exosomes derived from all the five cell lines (Supplementary Table 1). To test whether PKM2-promoted tumour cell exocytosis is through SNAP-23-mediated exocytic machinery, we first compared the levels of SNAP-23 and phosphorylated SNAP-23 (p-SNAP-23) in tumour or non-tumour cells (Fig. 3a). As shown, tumour cells
